A spark streaming analytic to read DNS log messages from a Kafka topic, compare the domains to the Malware Domain List, and alert on any malware domains found to a new Kafka topic.

The analytic assumes a Kafka topic has dnsmasq log messages, which generally will look like this:
```
"message":"Jan 22 15:26:31 dnsmasq[9958]: reply houzz.map.fastly.net is 151.101.192.93"
```

A copy of the [Malware Domain List](http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/mdl.php) (CSV file) must be present in HDFS. The fields of the CSV file are described in [this forum post](http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/forums/index.php?topic=3270.0).
